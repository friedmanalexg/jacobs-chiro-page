# Welcome to Jacobs Chiropractic
This website was written for Jacobs Chiropractic LLC by Alex Friedman in 2022. My goal with this site was to create a simple and responsive customer-facing frontend that would inform customers and drive new appointments. The website was designed with the intention of establishing Dr. Jacobs as a trustworthy local doctor who cares about his patients and is equipped to help them. 

## Technologies
This site uses a JavaScript-React frontend that has been heavily styled with Tailwind CSS. 

## Launch
Anticipated launch in December '22.

## Thanks
Thanks to my colleagues, The Killer Potatoes, for good company and helping me shake off some rust.
